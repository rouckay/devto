### End Notes ðŸ“‘
In this project we were tried to achieve a near to perfect clone of the original website as much as possible with very limited knowledge of React & Redux. This entire journey of has given us experiences and we have learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence.
