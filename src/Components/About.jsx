      <h1>About Dev</h1>
      <p>
        DEV is a community of software developers getting together to help one
        another out. The software industry relies on collaboration and networked
        learning. We provide a place for that to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
        DEV is built on <a href="">Forem</a> : open source software designed to
        empower communities. Because our application is{" "}
        <a href="">open source</a>, you can inspect every little detail of the
        code, or chip in yourself! Forem is available for anyone interested in
        creating similar communities in any niche or passion. Visit our meta
        Forem, <a href=""> forem.dev</a> for more information.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe in transparency and adding value to the ecosystem. We hope
        you enjoy poking around and participating!
